<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <p><strong>Disclaimer :</strong> using Lakka on your console <b>WILL</b> cause <b>battery calibration issues</b> when coming back to Horizon.</p>
  <p><b>Your console will shut down before reaching 0%</b>, usually between 40% and 15%. You will be unable to charge it back to its true 100%, and it will continue to shut down prematurely.</p>
  <p><b>There is a software fix that you can use thanks to CTCaer https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases/tag/v3.0</b> And another fix involves opening the console to unplug the battery connector.</p>
  <p><b>IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS : BACK OFF NOW - DO NOT USE LAKKA - WAIT FOR A SOFTWARE FIX</b></p>
