## How to update

**TL;DR** The same as you did to install it : download the tarball and extract it

1. Download the latest stable archive from [here]({% include download_link.html %}) (use your brain to grab the latest)
2. Extract the content of the directory in the archive and copy the `lakka` and `bootloader` folders to the root of your SD card
    * Windows users can use 7-Zip
    * Overwrite any existing file
